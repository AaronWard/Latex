\prefacesection{Introduction}

The goal of this assignment is to design a multiple layer neural network using the Tensorflow Library for a predictive model. Many factors will be taken into consideration for this project, such as the number of nodes needed in each layer, the number of layers and different learning rates. This report will document the two phases in implementing a neural network: Network Training and Network Evaluation. During training the model shall be trained by experimenting with different hyper parameters and the evaluation phase will load the trained model and test the metrics of the model in regards to data that it has not seen. The data being used consists of 500 rows of example data and 100 rows for evaluation. \\ The structure of this report will go by a design, the training process and the evaluation process, then followed by a conclusion.
