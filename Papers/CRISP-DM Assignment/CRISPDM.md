#Business understanding

1) The first stage is to understand what you want to accomplish from a business perspective. 
    - Give a statement on a highlevel
        "Help diagnose mengitis"

    - Assess the situation
        Resources: Give a list of the resources used for the project (data, software )
        The requirements: (schedule of completion)
        Contingencies: 


2)This information is then converted to a data mining problem. 
    - Give a second statement that goes into more depth
        "Using ages,sex, headache etc to accurately predict the the risk of someone getting meningitis" 
    
    - Define data-mining goals: deliverables, models, processed             datasets etc
    - Success Criteria: model accuracy - should be in quantitive terms

3) Project Plan
    - Outline a step by step plan for the project.
        - Give a schedule for completetion by each step and the required resources for each step.
        - Identify required capabilities for meeting the goals. (RapidMiner)
    

# Data Understanding

1) Gathering Data
    - verify you have the right data (Dunno how this will be relevant because we were given the fucking thing)
    - Load the data into rapidminer and check its compatible
    - Outline data requirements: what types of data are needed to meet the goals (get rid of all the shite not needed)
    - Confirm the right data exists: again, may not be applicable to us
    - Identify the specific datset you will use, and specify the tables, field etc that are relevent to this project
    - This is all a general description.

2) Describing Data
    -  verify that the data includes the fields that you expect and       need to be there and sufficient cases for analysis.
    -  What do the attribute names mean? explain

3) Data exploration
    - Get familiar with the data
    - Spot patterns in data
    - histograms, scatter plots, box charts. 

4) verifying data quality
    - Any missing data?
    - Identify data that doesn't make sense.
