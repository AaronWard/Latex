dataset allocation - go to moodle to see what dataset 
you need to work with.

Report template is on moodle
Work flow diagram will help with what to do
with your dataset

using crisp-dm 

	1) business understanding (half a page)
		business objective - one sentence (building a model to predict..)
		data mining - more detailed + jargan. =

	2) data understanding (like lab 1)
		summary statistics - copy into report
		look for outliers, quality issues (show you understand what you are looking out)
		just comment on what the significant attributes.
			
		atleast 3 times of charts( scatter plot, histogram etc)
		
	3) data preperation (last 2 labs)
		use atleat 3 techniques
		show you understand the techniques (sampling, scaling, binning...) and justify why.
		
	4) Data mining
		use atleast 2 algorithms
		(Neural networks, KNN, decision tree)

	5) Evaluation
		How successful you were at modeling the data set
		the overall accuracy
		discuss limitations of the data
