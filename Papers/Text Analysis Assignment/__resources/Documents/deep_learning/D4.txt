Recurrent networks are distinguished from feedforward networks by that feedback loop connected to their past decisions, ingesting their own outputs moment after moment as input. It is often said that recurrent networks have memory.2 Adding memory to neural networks has a purpose: There is information in the sequence itself, and recurrent nets use it to perform tasks that feedforward networks can’t.
