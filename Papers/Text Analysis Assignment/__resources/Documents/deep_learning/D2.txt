You might have already heard of image or facial recognition or self-driving cars. These are real-life implementations of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). In this blog post, you will learn and understand how to implement these deep, feed-forward artificial neural networks in Keras and also learn how to overcome overfitting with the regularization technique called "dropout".
