Recurrent Neural Networks are neural networks that are used for sequence tasks. The flaw of previous neural networks was that they required a fixed-size input, but RNNs can operate on variable-length input! They share their parameters across sequences and are internally defined by a recurrence relation. We formulated RNNs and discussed how to train them. Finally, we wrote code for a generic character-based RNN
