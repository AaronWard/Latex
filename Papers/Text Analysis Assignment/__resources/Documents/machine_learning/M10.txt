This post was written for developers and assumes no background in statistics or mathematics. The focus is on how the algorithm works and how to use it for predictive modeling problems. If you have any questions, leave a comment and I will do my best to answer.
Let’s get started.

KNN Model Representation
The model representation for KNN is the entire training dataset.
It is as simple as that.
KNN has no model other than storing the entire dataset, so there is no learning required.
Efficient implementations can store the data using complex data structures like k-d trees to make look-up and matching of new patterns during prediction efficient.
Because the entire training dataset is stored, you may want to think carefully about the consistency of your training data.
