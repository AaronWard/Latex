One of the latest investments in automation is a flexible packaging line featuring a “cobot” from Universal Robots, fitted with an RG6 gripper from the manufacturer of robot grippers, On Robot. The two "fingers" of the robot gripper have built-in intelligence and advanced technology that mimics the way humans instinctively use our sense of touch when we grab things to move them.
