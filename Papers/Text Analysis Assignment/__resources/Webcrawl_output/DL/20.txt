Product Insights for Airbnb

        

        


          I love studying users and products, and think data science can be extremely useful in guiding product/strategy as a whole. So I thought it would be fun to depart from the usual machine learning and engineering things I write about, and do a quick study of Airbnb.
Think of this like business analysis, or strategy – from a data science point of view. 
(It's in slide deck form, of course, because that's how these things roll.)
