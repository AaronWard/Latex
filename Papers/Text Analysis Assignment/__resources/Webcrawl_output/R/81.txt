Sex education should be giving us the information we need to feel in control of our bodies and make informed decisions about them â€“ but itâ€™s failing. In episode four of Vagina Dispatches, we (Mae and Mona) speak to our moms, friends and sex educators to find out why. Then we give the basics on some topics that are missing from the curriculum, from discharge to menopause.Subscribe to The Guardian â–º http://is.gd/subscribeguardianVagina Dispatches: what you didn't learn in sex edShow all 15 commentsWira Hadiantara: +Boho Belle  OKAdd a comment... 80 plus ones 80  6 shares 6  Post has attachmentThe GuardianPublicNov 7, 2016Naomi Klein at the Great Barrier Reef: what have we left for our children? â–º http://bit.ly/KleinReefIn Under the Surface, a special Guardian film, the award-winning writer and environmental campaigner Naomi Klein travels to the Great Barrier Reef with her son, Toma, to see the impact of coral bleaching caused by climate change. In a personal but also universal story, Klein tells how she wants him to bear witness. â€˜Just in case, amid the coral that is still alive, he can find something beautiful to connect with, something he can carry with him as he navigates life on a warmer, harsher planet than the one I grew up on. Because climate change is already here â€“ and kids are on the frontlinesâ€™.Subscribe to The Guardian â–º http://is.gd/subscribeguardianï»¿Naomi Klein at the Great Barrier Reef: what have we left for our children?Show all 15 commentsAdd a comment... 134 plus ones 134  15 shares 15  Post has attachmentThe GuardianPublicOct 27, 2016Margaret Hodge tells Owen Jones: 'The Tories may create tax haven conditions in the UK' â–º http://bit.ly/HodgeJonesThe former chair of the public accounts committee, Margaret Hodge, tells Owen Jones she fears the Conservative government may think the only way for the British economy to survive following the Brexit vote is to create tax haven-type conditions.

Half a million people dead and many more injured, Nelson returns to the people he met, re-photographs them, and asks why America is a nation still with an insatiable appetite for firearms.Gun Nation explores the paradox of why America's most potent symbol of freedom is also one of its greatest killers.Subscribe to The Guardian â–º http://is.gd/subscribeguardianDirector: Zed NelsonProducer: Zed NelsonEditor: Noah Payne FrankCommissioned by The Guardian and Bertha Foundation for the Guardian Bertha documentary partnershipGun NationShow all 58 commentsMarcus G. M. Gundlach: Das Problem ist nicht die zugesprochene Freiheit! Das Problem ist, das wer Waffen besitzt, diese auch einsetzt. Wer Waffen zur Selbstverteidigung besitzen und einsetzen mÃ¶chte sollte dies auf jeden Fall tun - aber er darf nicht erwarten, dass der Zugang zu diesen unreglementiert bleibt. Wer dies ablehnt und dafÃ¼r ist die US-Regierung Hauptverantwortlicher, der macht sich mitschuldig am Sterben Unschuldiger. Eine differenzierte Sicht tÃ¤te gut, ohne das Thema wie gerne in Europa praktiziert, zu  zerreden.
