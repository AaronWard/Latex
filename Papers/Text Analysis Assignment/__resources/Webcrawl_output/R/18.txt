Share stories with us securely and confidentially
     
     If used as directed, the Guardian SecureDrop service is a way in which you can share files with the Guardian confident of complete anonymity.

      While the platform itself uses Tor hidden services to support anonymity, it is advisable to be careful where you access it from. You should avoid using the platform on small networks where Tor usage may be monitored or restricted, or in public places where your screen may be viewed by CCTV. We recommend that you don't jump straight from this landing page to the SecureDrop site when uploading, especially on business networks that may be monitored. Best practise would be to make a note of the Tor url and upload your content from a different machine at a later time.
      
      The Guardian Secure Drop service is working normally.
      
 


  
    
      How to access the Guardian's Secure Drop service
    
      Download and install software to access the Tor network: https://www.torproject.org.

         
        For security reasons, we advise you, especially if you are uploading documents, 
        not to use your home or work network, but instead to use a public Wi-Fi network in an  area where your screen is not visible to security cameras. Alternately, you can boot 
        your computer from a USB key loaded with the Tails secure operating system, which is 
        available at  https://tails.boum.org  and includes the Tor web browser.
        Once you load the Tor browser, copy and paste the URL 33y6fjyhs3phzfjj.onion into the Tor address bar. When the page loads, you will find further instructions on how to submit files and messages to the Guardian.You will be assigned a randomly generated and unique code name. If a writer or editor at the Guardian wants to contact you about the information you have submitted, he or she will leave a message for you in SecureDrop. These messages are the only way we will be able to reach you, and this message can only be accessed using your code name. 
    
    
    The SecureDrop software is an open source project sponsored by the Freedom of the Press Foundation. The software has been through thorough independent security reviews to ensure that it meets stringent confidentiality and anti-leakage requirements. The platform has been built and commissioned with the latest fixes for the Heartbleed SSL vulnerability.
