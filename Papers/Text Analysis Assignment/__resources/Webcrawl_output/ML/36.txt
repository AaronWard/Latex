Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)
This section lists frequently asked questions and my best answers.

What programming language should I use for machine learning?
The specific programming language or platform does not matter.
I strongly believe that the best thing to focus on is how to work through machine learning problems end-to-end (learn more).That being said, I think if you’re not a strong programmer, that Weka is the best place to start because you can work through problems without writing a line of code (learn more).I think Python is excellent for developing models that can run in production, it is a growing platform (learn more).I think R might be the most powerful platform, but it requires learning a new programming language. I think the sweet spot for R is one-off projects and R&D projects (learn more).
Also, this post might help:
Best Programming Language for Machine Learning
If pressed to answer, I would recommend that you start with Python (learn more).
How do I get a job without a degree?
I teach a top-down and results-first approach to machine learning.
This means that you very quickly learn how to work through predictive modeling problems and deliver results.
As part of this process, I teach a method of developing a portfolio of completed projects. This demonstrates your skill and gives you a platform from which to take on ever more challenging projects.
It is this ability to deliver results and the projects that demonstrate that you can deliver results is what will get you a position.
Business only use credentials as a shortcut, they want results more than anything else.
Here’s more information on the portfolio approach:
Build a Machine Learning Portfolio
Here’s more information on why you don’t need a degree:
What if I Don’t Have a Degree?
Can you be my mentor or coach?
Thanks for asking.
I would love to help, but I just don’t have the capacity.
I do offer a structured and top-down approach to machine learning self-study. You can learn more about it here:
How to Get Started With Machine Learning
I am happy to continue to answer any machine learning questions you might have by email (one question at a time please).
Why do you focus on Python for machine learning?
I like to use different tools depending on the project.
Recently I have been focusing more attention on Python-based tools and libraries.
Recently, it seems that Python may be emerging as a dominant platform. Skills in Python for machine learning are in great demand. I am just serving this need.
See the post:
Python is the Growing Platform for Applied Machine Learning
Can you answer a question about a blog post?
Yes.
Please ask your question in the comments of the blog post.
Why don’t you have a post or book on […]?
I will get to it eventually I hope.
Until then, contact me and let me know about the topic you want me to cover.
What should I do if I’ve found an error?
Great!
Please contact me so that I can correct it.
What mathematical background do I need for machine learning?
I’m not your guy.
My mission is to help you get started and get good at applied machine learning using a “learn by doing” philosophy. I teach using a top-down and results-first approach.
If you want the bottom-up theory-first approach to machine learning, I would recommend a textbook or a multi-year graduate program. It is a path to theoretical machine learning and academia.
That being said, it is generally recognized that eventually, you will need to know your away around the intersection of these fields:
Linear AlgebraStatisticsProbability
Don’t make the beginners mistake of thinking you need to start here. Read this:
Machine Learning for ProgrammersThe Machine Learning Mastery Method
Also, read this post:
What If I Am Not Good At Mathematics
What is your background?
I have a bunch of degrees in computer science and artificial intelligence and I have worked many years in the tech industry in teams where your code has to work and be maintainable.
Academia was a bad fit for me, but I loved to research and to write. I think of myself as a good engineer that really wants to help other people get started and get good at machine learning, without wasting years of their life “getting ready to get started“.
More about my belief and my mission to help you be awesome at machine learning.
 
What machine learning project should I work on?
My best advice is to work on problems or with technology that most interests you.
Here are some more specific suggestions:
Consider working through a standard machine learning dataset:
Practice Machine Learning with Datasets from the UCI Machine Learning Repository7 Time Series Datasets for Machine Learning
Consider working on some more advanced datasets from competitive machine learning:
Tour of Real-World Machine Learning Problems10 Challenging Machine Learning Time Series Forecasting Problems
Consider working on problems that matter to you:
Work on Machine Learning Problems That Matter To You
Consider devising your own projects:
4 Self-Study Machine Learning Projects
What research topic should I work on?
I don’t know.
My focus is on industrial machine learning.
I think the best person to talk to about research topics is your research advisor.
Best of luck with your project.
Can I use your code in my own project?
Yes, but understand that it was developed and provided for educational purposes.
I take no responsibility for the code, what it might do or how you might use it.
Can you do some consulting?
No.
Sorry, I no longer have the capacity.
It takes too much time and mental space away from writing new tutorials and books, which is the most effective way I can help the most people.
Can you recommend someone?
No.
Sorry, I want to stay away from the whole recruiting thing.
From what I have experienced, the great people are always fully engaged. Your job is to find them and offer them something more interesting.
Can you help me with my project?
No.
Sorry, I don’t have the capacity to get involved in your project at the level you need or at a level to do a good job.
I am happy to answer any specific questions you have about machine learning.
Can you read, review, collaborate or help with my research paper?
No.
I no longer consider myself an academic. I cannot give you expert academic advice.
I am happy to answer any specific questions you have about machine learning.
What school, university, or course should I take?
I don’t know.
My focus is industrial machine learning, I no longer have an opinion on schools and courses.
If it looks good to you, go for it.
Remember, you do not need a higher degree to do very well in applied machine learning.
Can you read, review or debug my code?
No.
I’m eager to help, but I just don’t have the capacity to debug code for you.
I am happy to make some suggestions:
Consider aggressively cutting the code back to the minimum required. This will help you isolate the problem and focus on it.Consider cutting the problem back to just one or a few simple examples.Consider finding other similar code examples that do work and slowly modify them to meet your needs. This might expose your misstep.Consider posting your question and code to StackOverflow.
Can you help me setup or debug my development environment?
No.
I’m eager to help, but I just don’t have the capacity.
My material is generally intended for those that know their way around their own workstation and know how to install software.
Check these tutorials for setting up your environment:
How to Setup a Python Environment for Machine Learning and Deep Learning with AnacondaHow to Install a Python 3 Environment on Mac OS X for Machine Learning and Deep LearningHow to Create a Linux Virtual Machine For Machine Learning Development With Python 3
Consider posting your question and issue to StackOverflow.
