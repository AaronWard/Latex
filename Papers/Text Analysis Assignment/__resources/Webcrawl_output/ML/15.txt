is defined as:

  
    
      
        D
        
          (
          
            X
            ,
            Y
          
          )
        
        =
        
          
            (
            
              
                ∑
                
                  i
                  =
                  1
                
                
                  n
                
              
              
                |
              
              
                x
                
                  i
                
              
              −
              
                y
                
                  i
                
              
              
                
                  |
                
                
                  p
                
              
            
            )
          
          
            1
            
              /
            
            p
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle D\left(X,Y\right)=\left(\sum _{i=1}^{n}|x_{i}-y_{i}|^{p}\right)^{1/p}}
  

For 
  
    
      
        p
        ≥
        1
      
    
    {\displaystyle p\geq 1}
  
, the Minkowski distance is a metric as a result of the Minkowski inequality. When 
  
    
      
        p
        <
        1
      
    
    {\displaystyle p<1}
  
, the distance between (0,0) and (1,1) is 
  
    
      
        
          2
          
            1
            
              /
            
            p
          
        
        >
        2
      
    
    {\displaystyle 2^{1/p}>2}
  
, but the point (0,1) is at a distance 1 from both of these points. Since this violates the triangle inequality, for 
  
    
      
        p
        <
        1
      
    
    {\displaystyle p<1}
  
 it is not a metric.
Minkowski distance is typically used with p being 1 or 2, which correspond to the Manhattan distance and the Euclidean distance, respectively. In the limiting case of p reaching infinity, we obtain the Chebyshev distance:

                    i
                    =
                    1
                  
                  
                    n
                  
                
                
                  |
                
                
                  x
                  
                    i

                    |
                  
                  
                    p
                  
                
              
              )
            
            
              
                1
                p
              
            
          
        
        =
        
          max
          
            i
            =
            1
          
          
            n
          
        
        
          |
        
        
          x
          
            i
          
        
        −
        
          y
          
            i
          
        
        
          |
        
        .
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \lim _{p\to \infty }{\left(\sum _{i=1}^{n}|x_{i}-y_{i}|^{p}\right)^{\frac {1}{p}}}=\max _{i=1}^{n}|x_{i}-y_{i}|.\,}
  

Similarly, for p reaching negative infinity, we have:
