"Enlightenment Now: The Case for Reason, Science, Humanism, and Progress"
  Is the world really falling apart? Is the ideal of progress obsolete? Cognitive scientist and public intellectual Steven Pinker urges us to step back from the gory headlines and prophecies of doom, and instead, follow the data: In seventy-five jaw-dropping graphs, Pinker shows that life, health, prosperity, safety, peace, knowledge, and happiness are on the rise.

  Top customer reviewsThere was a problem filtering reviews right now. Please try again later.emoKid4.0 out of 5 starsGreat Overview Book, Spine cracks...January 8, 2014Format: Hardcover|Verified PurchaseThis book is really good for an introduction to all types of machine learning algorithms.  It has good detail for most of the algorithms.Some of the other reviewers say that it lacks depth.  This is somewhat true.  There are a few chapters that leave you wanting more, but overall I still think this is a good book.I have several machine learning books, and most of them are more in depth, but lacking a broader overview of machine learning.  So if you want an overview of different problem solving techniques, this is the book for you.  It has enough theory to keep most people happy.  If you want to know the core motivational aspect to the finest details, this book will be lacking in some areas.  Other books may have more detail, but just know they won't cover as much of the overall subject.This is always my go to book for trying to remember something.  It's small, light, and enough to get me back on track.  I have other books for more in depth reading, but they don't cover as much of the subject of machine learning as this one.Read moreComment|

  Report abuseDavid A. Resendez5.0 out of 5 starsIf you want to be an ML producer rather than consumerAugust 7, 2017Format: Paperback|Verified PurchaseThis book is a great starting point for machine learning. It's not directed towards application, it's more theory driven. If you're uncomfortable with symbolic logic you will struggle with this book. If you don't know symbolic logic I'd suggest a textbook in discrete mathematics before diving into this book. It would also help to know some linear algebra or set theory. If you have at least a Bachelors in Mathematics you'll be able to follow this book easily. That said, this book will help you become a producer of machine learning rather than a consumer of some out-of-the-box ML package.Read moreComment|Was this review helpful to you?

  Report abuseSteve Ryan5.0 out of 5 starsbut provides an excellent theoretical grounding in how many popular machine learning models ...September 24, 2017Format: Paperback|Verified PurchaseExceeded expectations.  For a 20 year old book an a fast-moving field, this book is right-on.  This is not a practical guide, as many of the tools that are used now did not exist when this book was published, but provides an excellent theoretical grounding in how many popular machine learning models are constructed.Read moreComment|

  Report abuseS. L.3.0 out of 5 starsGood as an Introduction/ to get overview on MLApril 24, 2009Format: Hardcover|Verified PurchaseThis is extremely intuitive and general point of view on ML.good for quick reading and getting introduced to the topic.I'd recommend this to people starting ML.then move on to more mathematically rigorous and specific books such as"Pattern Classification"/ "Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning" / Hastie's "Element of Statistical Learning"i never say this for a book. but it is too pricey for what it is offering.FYI i think they should increase the price of Chris Bishop's book.Read moreComment|

  Report abuseAdamg4.0 out of 5 starsGood but datedJune 23, 2014Format: Paperback|Verified PurchaseI'm not an expert, but I think the book is a bit dated.  It is interesting to flip through.  It has some serious analysis of ideas with at least some mathematical justification.  I don't recommend it as a first book, but I bought it very cheaply used and I am happy to have it on my bookshelf.Read moreComment|
