Cognitive scientist and public intellectual Steven Pinker urges us to step back from the gory headlines and prophecies of doom, and instead, follow the data: In seventy-five jaw-dropping graphs, Pinker shows that life, health, prosperity, safety, peace, knowledge, and happiness are on the rise.

			        		"...offers a thorough grounding in machine learning concepts as well as practical advice on applying machine learning tools and techniques in real-world data mining situations." "Co-author Witten is the author of other well-known books on data mining, and he and his co-authors of this book excel in statistics, computer science, and mathematics. Their in- depth backgrounds and insights are the strengths that have permitted them to avoid heavy mathematical derivations in explaining machine learning algorithms so they can help readers from different fields understand algorithms. I strongly recommend this book to all newcomers to data mining, especially to those who wish to understand the fundamentals of machine learning algorithms."--INFORMS Journal of Computing "The third edition of this practical guide to machine learning and data mining is fully updated to account for technological advances since its previous printing in 2005 and is now even more closely aligned with the use of the Weka open source machine learning, data mining and data modeling application. Beginning with an introduction to data mining, the volume explores basic inputs, outputs and algorithms, the implementation of machine learning schemes and in-depth exploration of the many uses of the Weka data analysis software. Numerous illustration, tables and equations are included throughout and additional resources are available through a companion website. Witten, Frank and Hall are academics with the department of computer science at the University of Waikato, New Zealand, the home of the Weka software project."--Book News, Reference & Research "I would recommend this book to anyone who is getting started in either data mining or machine learning and wants to learn how the fundamental algorithms work. I liked that the book slowly teaches you the different algorithms piece by piece and that there are also a lot of examples. I plan on taking a machine learning course this upcoming fall semester and feel that the book gave me great insight that the course will be based on mathematics more than I had originally expected. My favorite part of the book was the last chapter where it explains how you can solve different practical data mining scenarios using the different algorithms. If there were more chapters like the last one, the book would have been perfect. This book might not be that useful if you do not plan on using the Weka software or if you are already familiar with the various machine learning algorithms. Overall, Data Mining: Practical Machine Learning Tools and Techniques is a great book to learn about the core concepts of data mining and the Weka software suite."--ACM SIGSOFT Software Engineering Notes "This book is a must-read for every aspiring data mining analyst. Its many examples and the technical background it imparts would be a unique and welcome addition to the bookshelf of any graduate or advanced undergraduate student. The book is written for both academic and application-oriented readers, and I strongly recommend it to any reader working in the area of machine learning and data mining."--Computing Reviews.com

  Top customer reviewsThere was a problem filtering reviews right now. Please try again later.Sefa4.0 out of 5 starsgood textbook to start machine learning / data miningDecember 13, 2011Format: Paperback|Verified PurchaseThe book is really good to start learning machine learning and data mining.Pros- It doesn't jump into algorithms with mathematical details. It starts with what is it all about, what input and output look like in typical machine learning problems.- One point that I really liked is that the book gives algorithms in two chapters (chapter 4 and 6). The first chapter is about basics and latter one gives detail about these algorithms.- It also covers well that I think it is mostly ignored by other books/tutorials: practical issues. How to normalize data, what happens your data have both categorical and numerical features, discretizing numerical features and so on.- If you consider using Weka, you should have this book. Authors are from the team who built Weka. For each algorithm described in the book, corresponding names of implementations in Weka are given too. With the book it is easier to understand parameters of Weka implementations of algorithms. Also last part of the book is like extensive Weka tutorial.Cons- In a few points, the book contains unnecessary details, although it is not the case for overall of the book. One of such things that I remember is chapter 4.7. The book spends 5 whole pages to how to find nearest neighbor efficiently (not-easy stuff), which I think it is really implementation detail. Instead of it, it could explain what nearest neighbor is, or something else.- The part about Weka has several figures, mostly Weka screen shots. It was difficult to follow these figures, because of black-white screen shots. I think these figures should be in color in the next edition, which will make much easier to follow.Read moreComment|

  Report abuseJochen Albrecht5.0 out of 5 starsYou will need some time but it is worth the investmentDecember 11, 2011Format: Paperback|Verified PurchaseTo get the most out of this book, you need to either be a statistician, AI professional, or be willing to invest some time. But: if you commit yourself, then this book goes a long way to substitute for a graduate-level course on data mining. Don't get me wrong - it is not written with an academic audience in mind; as a matter of fact, it is unusually rich with application examples. But there is a lot to digest conceptually and many of the examples are quite involved. As such, it addresses the opposite end the O'Reilly series of how-to books. This one gets you up to speed with one of if not the best software package for data mining in all its many facets. With Weka and 'R', you have the tools to tackle many of the World's problems, and this book is the best introduction to one part of the duo.Read moreComment|

Gross5.0 out of 5 starsGreat bookAugust 27, 2014Format: Paperback|Verified PurchaseI am way too lazy to write a long winded review about this book but I recently took a graduate class at my university as an undergrad and the content was easy to understand. That course landed me an internship involving data mining so this book works. Caters to the plebeian beginner as well as the seasoned data scientist.Read moreComment|Was this review helpful to you?

  Report abuseJohn M. Ford4.0 out of 5 starsTwo Paths to PredictionFebruary 28, 2013Format: Kindle Edition|Verified PurchaseThis is a good text on machine learning techniques from both the statistics and the machine learning perspectives.  The authors note that these fields have developed in parallel with many researchers and practitioners working in each, but few familiar with the full range of techniques in both disciplines.  Some procedures, such as tree induction and nearest neighbor clustering techniques, have been developed independently in both fields.  However, for the most part statistics has focused on hypothesis testing and machine learning has tried to optimize search through the space of possible hypotheses.  This book presents techniques from both traditions.The organizational structure of the book supports its use as either a comprehensive text or a modular reference.  The first section's five chapters introduce the foundations of data mining.  In addition to concepts and definitions, there are simple example data sets and accessible descriptions of how both raw data and final analyses are used in this field.  A particularly well-written fifth chapter discusses how to evaluate data mining models.  It discusses the rationale for holdout samples, the use of cross-validation procedures, and how to avoid over-fitting models.  Machine learning texts frequently lack depth on this topic while statistics texts often fail to communicate the consequences of poorly-fitted models.  This integration of perspectives is a good one.Chapters in the second section build on this foundation.  Chapter 6 describes how to use ten different techniques to detect and describe patterns in large data sets.  This section also describes how to prepare data for data mining, how to combine and transform variables to increase model accuracy, and how to improve prediction by combining different model types using bagging, boosting, and other aggregation techniques.  A final chapter outlines directions of current and future research expanding our toolbox of techniques.  The eight chapters of the third and final section are a detailed tutorial covering the Weka workbench of machine learning algorithms and data transformation tools.This book has several communication strengths.  The scope is broad for an introductory text.  The Further Readings collections at each chapter's end are reasonably brief and point to current and in-depth sources.  The text itself contains numerous example analyses and follows the useful strategy of analyzing the same data with several techniques.  Its review of algorithms and formulas focuses on explaining how they work rather than on deriving them from general principles.  A key strength is the book's close integration with Weka.  This ensures that readers can step through analysis procedures, experiment with variations from default paths, and compare the performance of different formulations of the same research problems.I recommend the book for readers introducing themselves to machine learning.  It will take some of your time to learn the techniques and practice using them in Weka, but it will be time well spent.  Don't skip the Weka section!Read moreComment|
