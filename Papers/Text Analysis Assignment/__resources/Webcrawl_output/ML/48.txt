	A Gentle Introduction to Concept Drift in Machine Learning	
By Jason Brownlee on December 15, 2017  in Machine Learning Algorithms  
	
Data can change over time. This can result in poor and degrading predictive performance in predictive models that assume a static relationship between input and output variables. This problem of the changing underlying relationships in the data is called concept drift in the field of machine learning. In this post, you will discover the problem […]

	Learning Vector Quantization for Machine Learning	
By Jason Brownlee on April 18, 2016  in Machine Learning Algorithms  
	
A downside of K-Nearest Neighbors is that you need to hang on to your entire training dataset. The Learning Vector Quantization algorithm (or LVQ for short) is an artificial neural network algorithm that lets you choose how many training instances to hang onto and learns exactly what those instances should look like. In this post […]
