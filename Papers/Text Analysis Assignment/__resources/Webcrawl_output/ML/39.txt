				In machine learning, instance-based learning (sometimes called memory-based learning[1]) is a family of learning algorithms that, instead of performing explicit generalization, compares new problem instances with instances seen in training, which have been stored in memory.
It is called instance-based because it constructs hypotheses directly from the training instances themselves.[2] This means that the hypothesis complexity can grow with the data:[2] in the worst case, a hypothesis is a list of n training items and the computational complexity of classifying a single new instance is O(n). One advantage that instance-based learning has over other methods of machine learning is its ability to adapt its model to previously unseen data. Instance-based learners may simply store a new instance or throw an old instance away.
Examples of instance-based learning algorithm are the k-nearest neighbor algorithm, kernel machines and RBF networks.[3]:ch. 8 These store (a subset of) their training set; when predicting a value/class for a new instance, they compute distances or similarities between this instance and the training instances to make a decision.
To battle the memory complexity of storing all training instances, as well as the risk of overfitting to noise in the training set, instance reduction algorithms have been proposed.[4]
Gagliardi[5] applies this family of classifiers in medical field as second-opinion diagnostic tools and as tools for the knowledge extraction phase in the process of knowledge discovery in databases. One of these classifiers (called Prototype exemplar learning classifier (PEL-C) is able to extract a mixture of abstracted prototypical cases (that are syndromes) and selected atypical clinical cases.
