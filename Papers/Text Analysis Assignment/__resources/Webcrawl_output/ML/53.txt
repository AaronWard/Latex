				Which features should you use to create a predictive model?
This is a difficult question that may require deep knowledge of the problem domain.
It is possible to automatically select those features in your data that are most useful or most relevant for the problem you are working on. This is a process called feature selection.
In this post you will discover feature selection, the types of methods that you can use and a handy checklist that you can follow the next time that you need to select features for a machine learning model.

What is Feature Selection
Feature selection is also called variable selection or attribute selection.
It is the automatic selection of attributes in your data (such as columns in tabular data) that are most relevant to the predictive modeling problem you are working on.
feature selection… is the process of selecting a subset of relevant features for use in model construction
— Feature Selection, Wikipedia entry.
Feature selection is different from dimensionality reduction. Both methods seek to reduce the number of attributes in the dataset, but a dimensionality reduction method do so by creating new combinations of attributes, where as feature selection methods include and exclude attributes present in the data without changing them.
Examples of dimensionality reduction methods include Principal Component Analysis, Singular Value Decomposition and Sammon’s Mapping.
Feature selection is itself useful, but it mostly acts as a filter, muting out features that aren’t useful in addition to your existing features.
— Robert Neuhaus, in answer to “How valuable do you think feature selection is in machine learning?”
The Problem The Feature Selection Solves
Feature selection methods aid you in your mission to create an accurate predictive model. They help you by choosing features that will give you as good or better accuracy whilst requiring less data.
Feature selection methods can be used to identify and remove unneeded, irrelevant and redundant attributes from data that do not contribute to the accuracy of a predictive model or may in fact decrease the accuracy of the model.
Fewer attributes is desirable because it reduces the complexity of the model, and a simpler model is simpler to understand and explain.
The objective of variable selection is three-fold: improving the prediction performance of the predictors, providing faster and more cost-effective predictors, and providing a better understanding of the underlying process that generated the data.
— Guyon and Elisseeff in “An Introduction to Variable and Feature Selection” (PDF)
Feature Selection Algorithms
There are three general classes of feature selection algorithms: filter methods, wrapper methods and embedded methods.
Filter Methods
Filter feature selection methods apply a statistical measure to assign a scoring to each feature. The features are ranked by the score and either selected to be kept or removed from the dataset. The methods are often univariate and consider the feature independently, or with regard to the dependent variable.
Some examples of some filter methods include the Chi squared test, information gain and correlation coefficient scores.
Wrapper Methods
Wrapper methods consider the selection of a set of features as a search problem, where different combinations are prepared, evaluated and compared to other combinations. A predictive model us used to evaluate a combination of features and assign a score based on model accuracy.
The search process may be methodical such as a best-first search, it may stochastic such as a random hill-climbing algorithm, or it may use heuristics, like forward and backward passes to add and remove features.
An example if a wrapper method is the recursive feature elimination algorithm.
Embedded Methods
Embedded methods learn which features best contribute to the accuracy of the model while the model is being created. The most common type of embedded feature selection methods are regularization methods.
Regularization methods are also called penalization methods that introduce additional constraints into the optimization of a predictive algorithm (such as a regression algorithm) that bias the model toward lower complexity (fewer coefficients).
Examples of regularization algorithms are the LASSO, Elastic Net and Ridge Regression.
Feature Selection Tutorials and Recipes
We have seen a number of examples of features selection before on this blog.
Weka: For a tutorial showing how to perform feature selection using Weka see “Feature Selection to Improve Accuracy and Decrease Training Time“.Scikit-Learn: For a recipe of Recursive Feature Elimination in Python using scikit-learn, see “Feature Selection in Python with Scikit-Learn“.R: For a recipe of Recursive Feature Elimination using the Caret R package, see “Feature Selection with the Caret R Package“
A Trap When Selecting Features
Feature selection is another key part of the applied machine learning process, like model selection. You cannot fire and forget.
It is important to consider feature selection a part of the model selection process. If you do not, you may inadvertently introduce bias into your models which can result in overfitting.
… should do feature selection on a different dataset than you train [your predictive model] on … the effect of not doing this is you will overfit your training data.
— Ben Allison in answer to “Is using the same data for feature selection and cross-validation biased or not?”
For example, you must include feature selection within the inner-loop when you are using accuracy estimation methods such as cross-validation. This means that feature selection is performed on the prepared fold right before the model is trained. A mistake would be to perform feature selection first to prepare your data, then perform model selection and training on the selected features.
If we adopt the proper procedure, and perform feature selection in each fold, there is no longer any information about the held out cases in the choice of features used in that fold.
— Dikran Marsupial in answer to “Feature selection for final model when performing cross-validation in machine learning”
The reason is that the decisions made to select the features were made on the entire training set, that in turn are passed onto the model. This may cause a mode a model that is enhanced by the selected features over other models being tested to get seemingly better results, when in fact it is biased result.
If you perform feature selection on all of the data and then cross-validate, then the test data in each fold of the cross-validation procedure was also used to choose the features and this is what biases the performance analysis.
— Dikran Marsupial in answer to “Feature selection and cross-validation”
Feature Selection Checklist
Isabelle Guyon and Andre Elisseeff the authors of “An Introduction to Variable and Feature Selection” (PDF) provide an excellent checklist that you can use the next time you need to select data features for you predictive modeling problem.
I have reproduced the salient parts of the checklist here:
Do you have domain knowledge? If yes, construct a better set of ad hoc”” featuresAre your features commensurate? If no, consider normalizing them.Do you suspect interdependence of features? If yes, expand your feature set by constructing conjunctive features or products of features, as much as your computer resources allow you.Do you need to prune the input variables (e.g. for cost, speed or data understanding reasons)? If no, construct disjunctive features or weighted sums of featureDo you need to assess features individually (e.g. to understand their influence on the system or because their number is so large that you need to do a first filtering)? If yes, use a variable ranking method; else, do it anyway to get baseline results.Do you need a predictor? If no, stopDo you suspect your data is “dirty” (has a few meaningless input patterns and/or noisy outputs or wrong class labels)? If yes, detect the outlier examples using the top ranking variables obtained in step 5 as representation; check and/or discard them.Do you know what to try first? If no, use a linear predictor. Use a forward selection method with the “probe” method as a stopping criterion or use the 0-norm embedded method for comparison, following the ranking of step 5, construct a sequence of predictors of same nature using increasing subsets of features. Can you match or improve performance with a smaller subset? If yes, try a non-linear predictor with that subset.Do you have new ideas, time, computational resources, and enough examples? If yes, compare several feature selection methods, including your new idea, correlation coefficients, backward selection and embedded methods. Use linear and non-linear predictors. Select the best approach with model selectionDo you want a stable solution (to improve performance and/or understanding)? If yes, subsample your data and redo your analysis for several “bootstrap”.

				People can use my automatic feature dimension reduction algorithm published in:
Z. Boger and H. Guterman, Knowledge extraction from artificial neural networks models. Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Systems Man and Cybernetics, SMC’97, Orlando, Florida, Oct. 1997, pp. 3030-3035.
or contact me at optimal@peeron.com to get a copy of the paper..
The algorithm analyzes the “activities” of the trained model’s hidden neurons outputs. If a feature dose not contribute to these activities, it either “flat” in the data, or the connection weights assigned to it are too small. 
In both cases it can be safely discarded and the ANN retrained with the reduced dimensions.

				Nice Post Jason, This is an eye opener for me and I have been looking for this for quite a while. But my challenge is quite different I think, my dataset is still in raw form and comprises different relational tables. How to select best features and how to form a new matrix for my predictive modelling are the major challenges I am facing.
Thanks

				Actually i want to apply Chi square to find the independence between two attributes to find the redundancy between the two. The tools supporting CHI square feature selection only compute the level of independence between the attribute and the class attribute. May question is…what is the exact formula to use Chi square to find the level of independence between two attributes….?  PS: I cannot use an existing tool…thanks

				Great question Ralf.
Relative feature importance scores from RandomForest and Gradient Boosting can be used as within a filter method. 
If the scores are normalized between 0-1, a cut-off can be specified for the importance scores when filtering.

				Hi all,
Thanks Jason Brownlee for this wonderful article.
I have a small question. While performing feature selection inside the inner loop of cross-validation, what if the feature selection method selects NO features?. Do I have to pass all features to the classifier or What??

				Good question. If this happens, you will need to have a strategy. Selecting all features sounds like a good one to me.

				Hello Jason!
Great site and great article. I’m confused about how the feature selection methods are categorized though: 
Do filter methods always perform ranking? Is it not possible for them to use some sort of subset search strategy such as ‘sequential forward selection’ or ‘best first’?’
Is it not possible for wrapper or embedded methods to perform ranking? For example when I select ‘Linear SVM’ or “LASSO” as the estimator in sklearns ‘SelectFromModel’-function, it seems to me that it examines each feature individually. The documentation doesn’t mention anything about a search strategy.

				Good question Dado.
Feature subsets can be created and evaluated using a technique in the wrapper method, this would not be a filter method.
You can use an embedded within a wrapper method, but I expect the results would be less insightful.

				Hi, thx all or your sharing
I had a quation about the limitation of these methods in terms of number of features. In my scope we work on small sample size (n=20 to 40) with a lot of features (up to 50)
some people suggested to do all combinations to get high performence in terms of prediction.
what do you think?

				Hello Jason, 
As per my understanding, when we speak of ‘dimensions’ we are actually referring to features or attributes. Curse of dimensionality is sort of sin where dimensions are too much, may be in tens of thousand and algorithms are not robust enough to handle such high dimensionality i.e. feature space.
To reduce the dimension or features, we use algorithm such as Principle Component Analysis. It creates a combination of existing features which try to explain maximum of variance.
Question: Since, these components are created using existing features and no feature is removed, then how complexity is reduced ? How it is beneficially?
Say, there are 10000 features, and each component i.e. PC1 will be created using these 10000 features. Features didn’t reduced rather a mathematical combination of these features is created. 
Without PCA: GoodBye ~ 1*WorkDone + 1*Meeting + 1*MileStoneCompleted
With PCA: Goodbye ~ PC1
PC1=0.7*WorkDone + 0.2*Meeting +0.4*MileStoneCompleted

				Yes Jaggi, features are dimensions.
We are compressing the feature space, and some information (that we think we don’t need) is/may be lost.
You do have an interesting point from a linalg perspective, but the ML algorithms are naive in feature space, generally. Deep learning may be different on the other hand, with feature learning. The hidden layers may be doing a PCA-like thing before getting to work.

				Fantastic article Jason, really appreciate this in helping to learn more about feature selection.
If, for example, I have run the below code for feature selection:
test = SelectKBest(score_func=chi2, k=4)
fit = test.fit(X_train, y_train.ravel())
How do I then feed this into my KNN model? Is it simply a case of:
knn = KNeighborsClassifier()
knn.fit(fit) –is this where the feature selection comes in?
KNeighborsClassifier(algorithm=’auto’, leaf_size=30, metric=’minkowski’,
           metric_params=None, n_jobs=1, n_neighbors=5, p=2,
           weights=’uniform’)
predicted = knn.predict(X_test)

				Great post!
If I have well understood step n°8, it’ s a good procedure *first* applying a linear predictor, and then use a non-linear predictor with the features found before. Is it correct?

				Try linear and nonlinear algorithms on raw a selected features and double down on what works best.

				Sorry intrusion detection is not my area of expertise.
I would recommend going through the literature and compiling a list of common features used.

				Ultimately the skill of the model in making predictions.
That is the goal of our project after all!

				Hi!
I have a set of around 3 million features. I want to apply LASSO for feature selection/dimensionality reduction. How do I do that? I’m using MATLAB.

				When I use the LASSO function in MATLAB, I give X (mxn Feature matrix) and Y (nx1 corresponding responses) as inputs, I obtain an nxp matrix as output but I don’t know how to exactly utilise this output.

				Perhaps use an off-the-shelf efficient implementation rather than coding it yourself in matlab?

				HI..
  I need your suggestion on something. just assume i have 3 feature set and three models. for example f1, f2,f3 set. Each set produce different different output result in percentage. i need to assign weight to rank the feature set. any mathematical way to assign weight to the feature set based on three models output?

				Hi Jason! Thank you for your articles – you’ve been teaching me a lot over the past few weeks. 🙂
Quick question – what is your experience with the best sample size to train the model? I have 290 features and about 500 rows in my dataset. Would this be considered adequate? Or is the rule of thumb to just try and see how well it performs?
Many thanks!

				Hello Jason,
I am still confused about your point regarding the feature selection integration with model selection. From the first link you suggested, the advice was to take out a portion of the training set to do feature selection on. Next start model selection on the remaining data in the training set

my feature space is over 8000 attributes. When applying RFE, how can I select the right number of feature? By constructing multiple classfiers (NB, SVM, DT) each of which returns different results.

				There is no one best set or no one best model, just many options for you to compare. That is the job of applied ML.
Try building a model with each set and see which is more skillful on unseen data.

				Hi
I am getting a bit confused in the section of applying feature selection in cross validation step.
I understand that we should perform feature selection on a different dataset [let’s call it FS set ] than the dataset we use to train the model [call it train set].
I understand the following steps:
1) perform Feature Selection on FS set.
2) Use above selected features on the training set and fit the desired model like logistic regression model.
3) Now, we want to evaluate the performance of the above fitted model on unseen data [out-of-sample data, hence perform CV]
For each fold in CV phase, we have trainSet and ValidSet. Now we have to again perform feature selection for each fold [& get the features which may/ may not be same as features selected in step 1]. For this, I again have to perform Feature selection on a dataset different from the trainSet and ValidSet.
This is performed for all the k folds and the accuracy is averaged out to get the out-of-sample accuracy for the model predicted in step 2.
I have doubts in regards to how is the out-of-sample accuracy (from CV) an indicator of generalization accuracy of model in step 2. Clearly the feature sets used in both steps will be different.
Also, once I have a model from Step 2 with m<p features selected. How will I test it on completely new data [TestData]? (TestData is having p features and the model is trained on data with m features. What happens to the remaining p-m features??)
Thanks

				A simple approach is to use the training data for feature selection.
I would suggest splitting the training data into train and validation. Perform feature selection within each CV fold (automatically).
Once you pick a final model+procedure, fit on the training dataset use the validation dataset as a sanity check.

				Thank you Jason for your article, it was so helpful! I’m working on a set of data which I should to find a business policy among the variables. are any of these methods which you mentioned unsupervised? there’s no target label for my dataset. and if there is unsupervised machine learning method, do you know any ready code in github or in any repository for it?
