				It can be difficult to install a Python machine learning environment on some platforms.
Python itself must be installed first and then there are many packages to install, and it can be confusing for beginners.
In this tutorial, you will discover how to set up a Python machine learning development environment using Anaconda.
After completing this tutorial, you will have a working Python environment to begin learning, practicing, and developing machine learning and deep learning software.
These instructions are suitable for Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux platforms. I will demonstrate them on OS X, so you may see some mac dialogs and file extensions.
Update Mar/2017: Added note that you only need one of Theano or TensorFlow to use Kears for Deep Learning.
How to Setup a Python Environment for Machine Learning and Deep Learning with Anaconda
Overview
In this tutorial, we will cover the following steps:
Download AnacondaInstall AnacondaStart and Update AnacondaUpdate scikit-learn LibraryInstall Deep Learning Libraries
1. Download Anaconda
In this step, we will download the Anaconda Python package for your platform.
Anaconda is a free and easy-to-use environment for scientific Python.
1. Visit the Anaconda homepage.2. Click “Anaconda” from the menu and click “Download” to go to the download page.
Click Anaconda and Download
3. Choose the download suitable for your platform (Windows, OSX, or Linux):
Choose Python 3.5Choose the Graphical Installer

Choose Anaconda Download for Your Platform
This will download the Anaconda Python package to your workstation.
I’m on OS X, so I chose the OS X version. The file is about 426 MB.
You should have a file with a name like:

		
		
			
			
			
			
Anaconda3-4.2.0-MacOSX-x86_64.pkg
			
				
					1
				Anaconda3-4.2.0-MacOSX-x86_64.pkg
			
		


2. Install Anaconda
In this step, we will install the Anaconda Python software on your system.
This step assumes you have sufficient administrative privileges to install software on your system.
1. Double click the downloaded file.2. Follow the installation wizard.
Anaconda Python Installation Wizard
Installation is quick and painless.
There should be no tricky questions or sticking points.
Anaconda Python Installation Wizard Writing Files
The installation should take less than 10 minutes and take up a little more than 1 GB of space on your hard drive.
3. Start and Update Anaconda
In this step, we will confirm that your Anaconda Python environment is up to date.
Anaconda comes with a suite of graphical tools called Anaconda Navigator. You can start Anaconda Navigator by opening it from your application launcher.
Anaconda Navigator GUI
You can learn all about the Anaconda Navigator here.
You can use the Anaconda Navigator and graphical development environments later; for now, I recommend starting with the Anaconda command line environment called conda.
Conda is fast, simple, it’s hard for error messages to hide, and you can quickly confirm your environment is installed and working correctly.
1. Open a terminal (command line window).2. Confirm conda is installed correctly, by typing:


		
		
			
			
			
			
conda -V
			
				
					1
				conda -V
			
		

You should see the following (or something similar):

		
		
			
			
			
			
conda 4.2.9
			
				
					1
				conda 4.2.9
			
		


3. Confirm Python is installed correctly by typing:


		
		
			
			
			
			
python -V
			
				
					1
				python -V
			
		

You should see the following (or something similar):

		
		
			
			
			
			
Python 3.5.2 :: Anaconda 4.2.0 (x86_64)
			
				
					1
				Python 3.5.2 :: Anaconda 4.2.0 (x86_64)
			
		

Confirm Conda and Python are Installed
If the commands do not work or have an error, please check the documentation for help for your platform.
See some of the resources in the “Further Reading” section.
4. Confirm your conda environment is up-to-date, type:


		
		
			
			
			
			
conda update conda
conda update anaconda
			
				
					12
				conda update condaconda update anaconda
			
		

You may need to install some packages and confirm the updates.
5. Confirm your SciPy environment.
The script below will print the version number of the key SciPy libraries you require for machine learning development, specifically: SciPy, NumPy, Matplotlib, Pandas, Statsmodels, and Scikit-learn.
You can type “python” and type the commands in directly. Alternatively, I recommend opening a text editor and copy-pasting the script into your editor.

		
		
			
			
			
			
# scipy
import scipy
print('scipy: %s' % scipy.__version__)
# numpy
import numpy
print('numpy: %s' % numpy.__version__)
# matplotlib
import matplotlib
print('matplotlib: %s' % matplotlib.__version__)
# pandas
import pandas
print('pandas: %s' % pandas.__version__)
# statsmodels
import statsmodels
print('statsmodels: %s' % statsmodels.__version__)
# scikit-learn
import sklearn
print('sklearn: %s' % sklearn.__version__)
			
				
					123456789101112131415161718
				# scipyimport scipyprint('scipy: %s' % scipy.__version__)# numpyimport numpyprint('numpy: %s' % numpy.__version__)# matplotlibimport matplotlibprint('matplotlib: %s' % matplotlib.__version__)# pandasimport pandasprint('pandas: %s' % pandas.__version__)# statsmodelsimport statsmodelsprint('statsmodels: %s' % statsmodels.__version__)# scikit-learnimport sklearnprint('sklearn: %s' % sklearn.__version__)
			
		

Save the script as a file with the name: versions.py.
On the command line, change your directory to where you saved the script and type:

		
		
			
			
			
			
python versions.py
			
				
					1
				python versions.py
			
		

You should see output like the following:

		
		
			
			
			
			
scipy: 0.18.1
numpy: 1.11.1
matplotlib: 1.5.3
pandas: 0.18.1
statsmodels: 0.6.1
sklearn: 0.17.1
			
				
					123456
				scipy: 0.18.1numpy: 1.11.1matplotlib: 1.5.3pandas: 0.18.1statsmodels: 0.6.1sklearn: 0.17.1
			
		

What versions did you get?
Paste the output in the comments below.
Confirm Anaconda SciPy environment
4. Update scikit-learn Library
In this step, we will update the main library used for machine learning in Python called scikit-learn.
1. Update scikit-learn to the latest version.
At the time of writing, the version of scikit-learn shipped with Anaconda is out of date (0.17.1 instead of 0.18.1). You can update a specific library using the conda command; below is an example of updating scikit-learn to the latest version.
At the terminal, type:

		
		
			
			
			
			
conda update scikit-learn
			
				
					1
				conda update scikit-learn
			
		

Update scikit-learn in Anaconda
Alternatively, you can update a library to a specific version by typing:

		
		
			
			
			
			
conda install -c anaconda scikit-learn=0.18.1
			
				
					1
				conda install -c anaconda scikit-learn=0.18.1
			
		

Confirm the installation was successful and scikit-learn was updated by re-running the versions.py script by typing:

		
		
			
			
			
			
python versions.py
			
				
					1
				python versions.py
			
		

You should see output like the following:

		
		
			
			
			
			
scipy: 0.18.1
numpy: 1.11.3
matplotlib: 1.5.3
pandas: 0.18.1
statsmodels: 0.6.1
sklearn: 0.18.1
			
				
					123456
				scipy: 0.18.1numpy: 1.11.3matplotlib: 1.5.3pandas: 0.18.1statsmodels: 0.6.1sklearn: 0.18.1
			
		

What versions did you get?
Paste the output in the comments below.
You can use these commands to update machine learning and SciPy libraries as needed.
Try a scikit-learn tutorial, such as:
Your First Machine Learning Project in Python Step-By-Step
5. Install Deep Learning Libraries
In this step, we will install Python libraries used for deep learning, specifically: Theano, TensorFlow, and Keras.
NOTE: I recommend using Keras for deep learning and Keras only requires one of Theano or TensorFlow to be installed. You do not need both! There may be problems installing TensorFlow on some Windows machines.
1. Install the Theano deep learning library by typing:


		
		
			
			
			
			
conda install theano
			
				
					1
				conda install theano
			
		


2. Install the TensorFlow deep learning library (all except Windows) by typing:


		
		
			
			
			
			
conda install -c conda-forge tensorflow
			
				
					1
				conda install -c conda-forge tensorflow
			
		

Alternatively, you may choose to install using pip and a specific version of tensorflow for your platform.
See the installation instructions for tensorflow.
3. Install Keras by typing:


		
		
			
			
			
			
pip install keras
			
				
					1
				pip install keras
			
		


4. Confirm your deep learning environment is installed and working correctly.
Create a script that prints the version numbers of each library, as we did before for the SciPy environment.

		
		
			
			
			
			
# theano
import theano
print('theano: %s' % theano.__version__)
# tensorflow
import tensorflow
print('tensorflow: %s' % tensorflow.__version__)
# keras
import keras
print('keras: %s' % keras.__version__)
			
				
					123456789
				# theanoimport theanoprint('theano: %s' % theano.__version__)# tensorflowimport tensorflowprint('tensorflow: %s' % tensorflow.__version__)# kerasimport kerasprint('keras: %s' % keras.__version__)
			
		

Save the script to a file deep_versions.py. Run the script by typing:

		
		
			
			
			
			
python deep_versions.py
			
				
					1
				python deep_versions.py
			
		

You should see output like:

		
		
			
			
			
			
theano: 0.8.2.dev-901275534cbfe3fbbe290ce85d1abf8bb9a5b203
tensorflow: 0.12.1
Using TensorFlow backend.
keras: 1.2.1
			
				
					1234
				theano: 0.8.2.dev-901275534cbfe3fbbe290ce85d1abf8bb9a5b203tensorflow: 0.12.1Using TensorFlow backend.keras: 1.2.1

				It has been more than a decade since I have used Windows.
Maybe it’s called command prompt or terminal?

				To use Keras, you only need TensorFlow OR Theano. If you have installed Theano, you can start using Keras.

				The output looks OK for versions.py, shown as follows

sklearn: 0.18.1
Though the output from deep_versions.py is consistent with those in the post for theano and tensorflow, there is warning for theano installation.  Is it the reason for the failure of keras installation?

				Consider installing Keras 1.2.2 instead that will work with tensorflow 1.0.
Keras 2.0 requires tensorflow 1.0.1+
For example:


		
		
			
			
			
			
sudo pip install keras==1.2.2
			
				
					1
				sudo pip install keras==1.2.2

				Hi, Jason, I have successfully installed theano and keras, but when I ran my code in spyder, I met with the problem ” the kernel died and restarting” repeatedly, I’d appreciate it if you can help me with this.

				Perhaps try running from the command line. Editors and notebooks often cause or hide errors.

				Hi Yash, sorry to hear that. Consider installing the Python 2.7 version of Anaconda instead, or find an alternate way to install Theano on your system.

				Hello,
I wrote a very similar article on how to install Keras and Tensorflow (CUDA and CPU) on Windows over a month ago. It also uses the Anaconda environment. It will work with Python 3.5 and I also just updated it to support Keras 2.0 as well. I use it nearly everyday for my own work, so I can confirm that it works.
If anybody is interested, here is the link: http://discover-fx.com/set-up-your-own-keras-with-tensorflow-gpu-deep-learning-environment-on-windows-8-1-and-10/.
Hope it helps somebody out there!
Clark

				In my 64 bit Windows and 3.6 Python anaconda(64bit) I am unable to install tensorflow
In links suggested by you they say tensorflow on Windows is only supported for 3.5.x python or less
I tried all the commands I could browse on the internet
What should I do next?

				Hi Ram, to use Kease you only need Theano OR TensorFlow. If you can install Theano, then you can use Keras.

				For those who are stuck at installing Tensorflow because of the Python version (I’m on Anaconda 4.3.1 with python 3.6)
You can create conda environment before installing theano
C:> conda create -n tensorflow python=3.5
C:> activate tensorflow
Keras use tensorflow by default, but I encounter error everytime I tried to install keras before theano

				Hi Jason,
I had an issue with installing Tensorflow in Win7 PC. During install it stated that Python 3.6 and Tensorflow 3.5 are incompatible.
I then uninstalled everything and started fresh and left out Tensorflow. Not sure if that’s going to be an issue (your note indicated that only either keras or tensorflow are needed).

				You only need Theano OR TensorFlow for deep learning with Keras, not both.
You can comment out the line that checks the TensorFlow version.
You can update Keras to use Theano by editing the config file, see here:

				Hi Jason,

tensorflow: 1.1.0-rc2
Using TensorFlow backend.
keras: 2.0.3
TensorFlow wasn’t easy, got to google the many errors I saw.
i’m using Intel i5-6300 @2.4GHz and I see the deep_versions.py takes at least 5 seconds to load.. is it ok?
Thanks,
Eid

				Well done!
Yes, that is normal as it has to load a lot of libs into memory. Specifically Theano can be very slow to start. The second time it is run should be much faster.

				I eventually used the last Anaconda3 version I found with python 3.5
https://repo.continuum.io/archive/index.html
Anaconda3-4.2.0-Windows-x86_64.exe
After that install I followed the steps and got
python deep_versions.py

				Hello, I got this error when trying to use anaconda. I believe it was installed into the incorrect directory as it was installed by default into the Macintosh HD instead of the python folder.

				I’m sorry to hear that.
Perhaps you need to re-open your terminal after anaconda was installed?

				You can ignore those warnings for now unless you want to dive into compiling tensorflow from scratch on your system (not recommended).

				Hi I’m getting the following:
python deep_version.py
Could not find platform independent libraries
Could not find platform dependent libraries
Consider setting $PYTHONHOME to [:]
Fatal Python error: Py_Initialize: Unable to get the locale encoding
ImportError: No module named ‘encodings’
Current thread 0x00007f60ac325700 (most recent call first):

Do you know what is causing this? I’ve read multiple python installs but I have 2.7.12 and 3.6.2 and don’t think these two should conflict…thanks!

				Hi, Jason
Congratulations and thanks for your excellent pages!
My environment is like this:
scipy: 0.19.0
numpy: 1.13.0
matplotlib: 2.0.2
pandas: 0.20.1
statsmodels: 0.8.0
sklearn: 0.18.1
and tensorflow 1.2.1 – as far as I understand it includes keras as tensorflow.keras – but I shall soon find out how things stand when I begin development 🙂

				Finally got it after 5 hours of effort on tensorflow cpu, no module found tensorflow was the error in an anaconda command prompt, I ran “python -m pip install tensorflow” which fixed the issue in Windows 10. Also, had setup the tensorflow  with python 3.5, trying to switch keras backend and configs to theanos was unsuccessful for me as well.

				Had trouble configuring Tensorflow on a Windows and Python 2.7 environment. Seems like you need at least Python 3.5 for Tensorflow on Windows.
Switching the Keras Backend to Theano, however, worked fine for me. You need to alter a JSON-Init file to ‘theano’ and that’s it. The Keras.io Project Site has a nice page about switching backends with easy-to-follow instructions.
Additional hint I learnt there:
print(‘keras Backend: %s’ % keras.backend.backend())
returns the Backend currently in use.

				If you install Anaconda 4.4.0 which by default bundles with Python 3.6, you HAVE TO downgrade Python to v3.5 before install tensorflow. Here is what I got 🙂

				I got:
conda 4.3.22
Python 3.5.3 :: Anaconda 4.4.0 (32-bit)
scipy: 0.19.0
numpy: 1.12.1
matplotlib: 2.0.2
pandas: 0.20.1
statsmodels: 0.8.0
sklearn: 0.18.2
HOWEVER, I FAIL at installing tensorflow. Please HELP. 
I created a conda ‘tensorflow’ environment with python 3.5. With command
『pip install –ignore-installed –upgrade https://storage.googleapis.com/tensorflow/windows/cpu/tensorflow-1.2.1-cp35-cp35m-win_amd64.whl』
I got ERROR saying
『tensorflow-1.2.1-cp35-cp35m-win_amd64.whl is not a supported wheel on this platform』
So i changed to version 1.0.1 and same error.
Version 1.1.0 also same error. 
So i deactivated the environment, and type command『conda install -c conda-forge tensorflow』
I got ERROR『PackageNotFoundError: Package missing in current win-32 channels』 Instead it says the close match found is “xtensor” which i don’t know what is it. 
Is it because I’m using a 32-bit Windows 10?
So I also tried running the following :
『python -m pip install –upgrade tensorflow』
and got ERROR of『Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement tensorflow (from versions: ) No matching distribution found for tensorflow』
What more requirements do i need for this? 
I tried 『pip3 install tensorflow』 but somehow it could not recognized ‘pip3’. So i type 『where pip3』 and it could not find files for the given pattern. So i type『where python』. It ouput the directory of my python. Then checked if it’s already put under the path inside the environmental variable. And it has. 
I’ve been stuck for dayssss and actually postponed my projects for months because of this. Please help it means a LOT o(╯□╰)o

				Hello Amira – As I mentioned in previous post, you HAVE TO either upgrade python to 3.5 or create py35 environment.  I didn’t try to create py35 environment instead I downgraded python 3.6 to python 3.5 by simply typing “conda install python=3.5” right after Aanconda 4.4 installed.  Then you just follow the procedure Jason provided.  it worked perfectly.   Good luck.

				Thank you Mr. Jason for sharing such a useful resource.
I just wanted to know if there is any way i can install Tensorflow GPU,because my machine has AMD (Radeon) and want to perform computation on my GPU instead of CPU.I have studied the documentation for Tensorflow which supports Nvidia Cuda only.

This was a HUGE pain to get through and I’m still not 100% sure I did it right, but I’m very much looking forward to writing some actual script.  I GREATLY appreciate your direction on this!

				Open the command line and type:


		
		
			
			
			
			
python
			
				
					1
				python
			
		


This will open the python interpreter.

				Without using a C++ compiler my setup (see below) works well (but slow of course). I used the code example of your book “Deep Learning with Python\Develop your first neural network with Keras (page 47, capter 7.8)”.
To speed up the runtime I installed TDM-GCC. Then an import error “DLL load failed” was shown – even after installing OpenBLAS.
I know that I didn’t follow exactly your installation guide on this site but it seems to me there’s only a penny to success. Maybe you/someone else had the same problem and knows a solution?
Installed software:
– Windows 10 Home
– Python 3.6.1 (v3.6.1:69c0db5) [MSC v.1900 64 bit (AMD64)] on win32
– numpy (1.13.0rc2+mkl) (installed as wheel)
– scipy (0.19.0) (installed as wheel)
– scikit-learn (0.18.1) (installed as wheel)
– Theano (0.9.0)
– Keras (2.0.6)
– gcc version 5.1.0 (tdm64-1)
– OpenBLAS-v0.2.19-Win64-int32
I added the following entries to the path:
C:\Python36\
C:\TDM-GCC-64\bin\
C:\TDM-GCC-64\x86_64-w64-mingw32\bin\
C:\TDM-GCC-64\x86_64-w64-mingw32\lib\
C:\OpenBLAS-v0.2.19-Win64-int32\bin\
C:\OpenBLAS-v0.2.19-Win64-int32\lib\
My theaonrc.txt looks like this:
[global]
floatX = float32
device = cpu
cxx=C:\\TDM-GCC-64\\bin\\g++.exe
[blas]
ldflags = -LC:\\OpenBLAS-v0.2.19-Win64-int32\\bin -LC:\\OpenBLAS-v0.2.19-  Win64-int32\\lib -lopenblas
Trace log which shows the error:

				Fabulously simple and cool, just as the rest of this site.
Please note that Keras is now available with CNTK backend as well. 
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cognitive-toolkit/Using-CNTK-with-Keras
A good option for Windows users here.

				Nice tutorial, I install on windows using Anaconda.
printed out  using the notebook and results were:
import keras
print(‘keras: %s’ % keras.__version__)
WARNING (theano.configdefaults): g++ not available, if using conda: conda install m2w64-toolchain
WARNING (theano.configdefaults): g++ not detected ! Theano will be unable to execute optimized C-implementations (for both CPU and GPU) and will default to Python implementations. Performance will be severely degraded. To remove this warning, set Theano flags cxx to an empty string.

				Nice!
You can ignore the warnings for now.

				hi profecer I have installed anaconda with the appropriate libreries but my backend is theano but when am writing a sample code of python it displays an error message
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File “C:/Users/dave/PycharmProjects/AccuracyPlot/AccuracyLossPlot.py”, line 2, in
    from keras.models import Sequential
ImportError: No module named keras.models
so what can I do Sir? I need your help

				Try running code from the command line, perhaps your IDE or notebook is causing faults (they often do!)

				Thanks a lot Jason for this very useful article. I am a windows user and I had installed theano tensorflow and keras incorrectly which corrupted my numpy as well. Consequently, I had to reinstall anaconda and using this article I was able to set up the required packages perfectly.
As you correctly pointed out, Keras can now be run using either theano or tensorflow ( and window users may want to avoid tensorflow). However, keras uses tensorflow by default to run and this needs to be changed if the user has only installed theano and keras. This can be done by updating the ‘backend’ field from tensorflow to theano in the keras.json file which can be found in the user/.keras path.

				below is the code I used to update the keras.json file using python.
import json
with open(‘keras.json’, ‘r’) as f:
    json_data = json.load(f)
    json_data[‘backend’] = “theano”
with open(‘keras.json’, ‘w’) as f:
    f.write(json.dumps(json_data))

				Dear Jason, 
your articles are best!!
Is there any flag in keras that is used to force keras to use either GPU or CPU

				No. Use of CPU/GPU is configured in the underlying math library (theano or tensorflo).

				Quick question, I already have Python 3.6 running on my windows machine. Does installing Anaconda3 install a second version of python? It sure looks like it from the directory.

Is it alright?
Though keras is imported, it throws out an error while displaying its version.

				These are the results from my Windows 10 machine:

tensorflow: 1.3.0

keras: 2.0.8
And these are from my Linux machine:

tensorflow: 1.3.0

Any idea why keras would only go to 2.0.2 in Linux?

				Instead I followed the “alternative” route of installing keras as by it´s documentation:
– Used GIT to clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/fchollet/keras.git
– Run from the local directory: python setup.py install
The versions script (without theano) then gives: 
tensorflow: 1.3.0
Using TensorFlow backend.
keras: 2.0.8

				I was able to get rid of it by “conda install -c conda-forge keras” and that’s it.

				Some tips for Windows users:
1) Installing Anaconda with all of the default settings doesn’t add conda to the Windows path, so it isn’t recognized as a command in the Windows command window. You might see a ” ‘conda’ is not recognized as an internal or external command” error.
I worked around this by using the Anaconda Prompt, which seems to set up the environment properly. 
A potential revision of the text would be 
[…] 1. Open a terminal (command line window).
     a. Windows users may want to go to the Start menu and use the “Anaconda Prompt”. […] 
Checking the box to add Anaconda to the PATH during installation will probably also work, but I haven’t tried it myself. 
2) TensorFlow is hard to install on Windows, but if you try skipping it, you can’t import Keras because it tries to use TensorFlow by default. You can get around this by changing the default Keras backend:
Suggested text revision: 
[…] Save the script to a file deep_versions.py. 
If you’re on Windows and skipped installing TensorFlow, you’ll want to change Keras’s default backend. Open C:\Users\\.keras\keras.json in a text editor and change the entry for “backend” from “tensorflow” to “therano”. 
Run the script by typing: […]

				Hi Jason, I saw warnings, do you know what is the problem?
WARNING (theano.configdefaults): Only clang++ is supported. With g++, we end up with strange g++/OSX bugs.
WARNING (theano.configdefaults): g++ not detected ! Theano will be unable to execute optimized C-implementations (for both CPU and GPU) and will default to Python implementations. Performance will be severely degraded. To remove this warning, set Theano flags cxx to an empty string.

				Sorry, I don’t know about this warning. 
Perhaps try a search or even a post to StackOverflow?
I do have an OS X specific tutorial here that may help:

 I have installed the tools successfully but while importing keras, it is searching for tensorflow. i had installed only theano.

				You might need to reconfigure Keras to use Theano instead of the default TensorFlow. See the config file in ~/.keras/keras.json.

				I have to write a python program to load pre-trained vectors and compute cosine similarities. And i have to adapt it to compute the 353 similarities on the two given word embedded models and then to compute the correlation with human judgement.
Using the two models:
– Word2Vec
– Glove 
I want to know what i need exactly tod perform this work.

However, I’m currently running issues on importing theano in python. I was able to download it with the “conda install theano” command, but when I try to import, python crashes and some of the traceback is shown below:

Any suggestions on how to tackle this issue?

				Thanks for the post.
Is there any specific reason why you are using pip for installing keras instead of
conda install -c conda-forge keras?

				It looks like warnings that you could ignore.
Perhaps there is documentation on how you can install an alternate version better suited to your specific hardware?

				Thank you for this incredibly useful blog. I have programmed in assembly language, pascal Delphi and C++. I started an AI project in Delphi and thought PYTHON should be a much easier track, so I went with Anaconda3. Little did I know that I would be spending most of my time simply trying to reconcile the differences between documented language usage and the updated Python 3.5.

I have tried most of the way by setting virtual environment thing and all.

				i’ve had about enough with import errors and labelencoder errors. tried to setup the environment several times on mac os and windows 10, followed these instructions each time and each time i got proper versions for the installed packages. it all goes south when i try to import the packages or when i execute the labelencoder command. i’m this close to installing linux and trying it over there. but really, it’s the 5th time i’m reinstalling anaconda3 and pycharm, frustrating as F!@#.

				Sorry to hear that. The tutorial has seemed to work for tens of thousands of others.
– Perhaps you need to reboot after install?
– Perhaps you have 2 versions of Python installed accidentally, e.g. Python and anaconda?
– Perhaps you are trying to run code in the wrong place?
What errors are you getting exactly?

				The errors i’ve encountered were diverse, haven’t written them down because i’ve always tried to do fresh installs hoping it will work. Thanks for the reply, i’ll talk to some programmer friends of mine, surely they can help. I’ll get back to you if i’ve got better questions 😛

				i’m using a 3 year old MacBook pro without any special video cards.  is it safe to install deep learning libraries?  I heard somewhere that it will burn the processor? (I’m completely new to this, sorry if the questions are dumb…).
Also, do you suggest Theano or Tensorflow for the macbook?  Is there any difference for when actually using them?  
I’m still learning with a plan of getting to do Kaggle competitions.
I already have anaconda and scikitlearn installed

				I had a similar issue and solved it by following the next steps:
1. Go to the Windows search on the task bar and look for “Edit the system environment variables”. The best match be something in the control panel. Click it.
2. Click on “Environment Variables…”
3. Click on “New…”. In “Variable name” fill in “MKL_THREADING_LAYER”. In “Variable value” fill in “GNU” (no quotations in any case)
4. Click “OK” on each open dialogue
5. Restart Windows.
That did it for me!
Last but not least, thank you, Jason, for such a helpful tutorial

				I recommend working from the command line.
The “current directory” is the directory on the command line where the code and data are located and the same place from where you execute the script.

				The error suggests tensorflow is not installed or is installed but is not available in the python environment you have started.

				These are the versions I got after I installed the Deep Learning libraries today, 5 Feb 2018:
theano: 1.0.1
tensorflow: 1.5.0
Using TensorFlow backend.
keras: 2.1.3
I would like to add that I looked up the instructions for installing TensorFlow on WIn7, which requested that I set up a special “tensorflow space” in conda first. By then I had already installed theano, and after installing tensorflow I left the “tensorflow space” and installed keras. 
Nothing worked then; but after going back to the “tensorflow space” and again installed theano and keras there, everything worked fine. So keep an eye on any change of “space in conda you might be asked to do; an installation is “space-specific”. See also “https://www.tensorflow.org/install/install_windows”.
It also seems that in order to have a “good” implementation of theano, you need a c++ compiler installed. Without that, you apparently get a low-performance version of (some?) libraries.

				i encountered an error:
raise RuntimeError(‘To use MKL 2018 with Theano you MUST set “MKL_THREADING_LAYER=GNU” in your environment.’)
RuntimeError: To use MKL 2018 with Theano you MUST set “MKL_THREADING_LAYER=GNU” in your environment.
any idea how to resolve this?

				This worked: “set MKL_THREADING_LAYER=GNU”
But now I got:
theano: 1.0.1
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File “deep_versions.py”, line 5, in
    import tensorflow
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named ‘tensorflow’
The instructions said that I don’t need tensorflow if I install Theano. Does it mean I’m goof to go further now?

Yes, just one of tensorflow or theano is required.

				Hi Jason，
I installd all the library.
I got :
sklearn: 0.19.1
WARNING (theano.tensor.blas): Using NumPy C-API based implementation for BLAS functions.
theano: 1.0.1
I searched StackOverFlow.This can be fixed by:
sudo apt-get install libblas-dev 
but I’m running on Windows.Do you know how to install libblas-dev on Windows10?

				I wonder if one ought to consider downgrading tensorflow when performing the installation on an iMac Pro. It would appear that the GPU is not used in the version I have installed. Do you have any recommendations for setting ML/DL environment tailored for an iMac Pro (mine has 18 cores). I want to make sure it takes full advantage of the hardware. I can confirm Anaconda does use the 18 cores, however I do not see hyper threading taking place, nor is the GPU being used.

				GPU support only works with nvidia video cards as far as I know and all the macs I’ve owned come with radeon (or something).
I recommend dev/spot checking on the workstation and running large models on the GPU on AWS:

				It looks like you have Theano installed and you got a warning. You can ignore the warning.
It also looks like you might need to change the configuration of Keras to use Theano instead of tensorflow. You can do that in the ~/.keras/keras.json config file.
Then comment out the line in deep_versions.py for tensorflow and try re-running it.
Let me know how you go.

				In the step last step I was facing an issue “RuntimeError: To use MKL 2018 with Theano you MUST set “MKL_THREADING_LAYER=GNU”  in your environement.”. Installing mkl solved it for me.
e.g:
“conda install mkl=2017”
