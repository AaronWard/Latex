\section*{Business Understanding}

This following sections shall describe the business objectives, the mining objectives, a analysis and plan for the proposed project.

\subsection*{Business Objective}
The objective of this project is to mine non-structured data using Rapid Miner.

\subsection*{Data Mining objective}
\begin{itemize}
	\item The main objective is to mine articles about Machine Learning, Deep Learning and Robotics. 
	\item Web crawling will be implemented to find related text on the topics.
	\item Multiple clustering and classification models will be used to identify the texts.
\end{itemize}
