\prefacesection{Regular Expression Parser}
The following report with describe a regular expression parser along with it's design and implementation. The parser shall take a given input and do an analysis of regular expressions. This report will consist of three parts. Firstly. A section of the lexical categories will be brought forward to discuss the architecture of the lexicon. A section on the implementation will be provided to describe the program being developed and how it interacts with the lexical entries. Lastly, a system architectures section will state the issues that were encountered during the process of development and how they were resolved. Moreover, A conclusion will be given to summarize the points made during the report.

\section*{Lexical Categories}
% e.g. noun, verb etc. in terms of the architecture of the lexicon


\section*{Implementation}
% describing how you have implemented your parser program and its interface to the lexicon and how it uses the lexical entries.  


\section*{System Architecture}
%providing a description of your software design stating the problems that you needed to address and how you surmounted them... for each of these, state individually the problem and then your solution.  



\section*{Conclusion}
