\prefacesection{Background}

The field of artificial intelligence and machine learning has become exponentially prominent in our daily lives.
From business to social media, machine learning algorithms are being used to change the definition of efficiency and user experience.
For example, Artificial intelligence algorithms are utilised by many companies such as Facebook and Google to optimize the experience
with image and voice recognition and photo searching \citep{adit}. Also, Motor companies such as Tesla Motors use computer vision for their self 
driving cars, which is a form of artificial intelligence. 
The following proposal will highlight and explain the research at hand with a number of sections. Initially, The main research questions 
will be introduced to lay the groundwork for the motivation of this research. Justification to why the research being proposed shall also be given.
An account on feasibility shall be brought forward to indicate the technical requirements, followed by the proposed methodologies, which gives insight as 
to how the research project shall be implemented. Furthermore, the last section shall provide the expected results, conclusion and references. A project plan is also set in
place to illustrate the scope and outlook of the project.
