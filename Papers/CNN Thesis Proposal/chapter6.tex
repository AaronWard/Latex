\prefacesection{Expected Results}

A number of results are possible with this research. Initially, the most expected result to be envisioned is that it goes according to the proposed methodology. The application records the humans face, and using the training convolutional neural network, can classify the emotions of the human. This however, may not be end result of the project. Depending on the time of the finished implementation, extra features may also be included in the software. This may include natural language processing, tone analyzing, speech-to-text or a chatbot-like feature, that shall allow the AI to respond in a human-like manner.
Furthermore, should the training fail or surpass the free tier quota, the option of a pre-trained may be needed. Although this is not a desirable method, it would be needed in order to complete the project.
