The purpose of this assignment is to implement a fuzzy logic controller using a feed back system. In this case, the fuzzy logic controller is a water pumping system that controls a bidirectional pump to maintain water levels of a reserve between 40\% and 70\%. There are two main factors that affect the water levels: The demand for water for appliances, which drains the tank of water and rainfall that may occur, that fills the tank with water. \\
This report will detail and explain the choices made when designing the linguistic variable and rule terms. Diagrams will be used to illustrate the linguistic variables for further explanation.
