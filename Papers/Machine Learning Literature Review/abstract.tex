\prefacesection{Introduction}
The following literature review will provide and insight and analysis into the current research regarding machine learning and artificial intelligence, specifically on the topic of neural networks. The paper shall consist of a review of five papers based on computer vision, convolutional neural networks or sentiment analysis research. This is followed by a related work section, which shall display the relevance of these papers to the proposed research given and the similarities between the two. Furthermore, a critical analysis shall be given into the quality of these papers, outlining some inconsistencies and weak points, if any. This paper will not explore the papers based on the theory of neural networks, but the research that implements them.
