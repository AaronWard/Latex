In conclusion, this paper has reviewed five papers in relation to convolutional neural networks, facial sentiment analysis, emotion detection and current applications in the real world. Relevant aspects include detecting employees emotions in a work environment, implementing a score fusion algorithm for achieve a summation of two sentiment detecting technologies, the idea of segmenting facial features while training to accommodate for variability and the notion using human emotion understanding for a business solution.
