\chapter{Introduction and Background} 
The field of artificial intelligence and machine learning has become exponentially prominent in our daily lives.
From business to social media, machine learning algorithms are being used to change the definition of efficiency and user experience.
For example, Artificial intelligence algorithms are utilised by many large companies optimize the experience with image and voice recognition and photo searching \citep{adit}. Also, Motor companies such as Tesla Motors use computer vision for their self-driving cars, which is a form of artificial intelligence. 

The researcher and founded of convolutional neural networks (CNN's), Yann LeCun, became the director of Facebook's Artificial Intelligence department in 2013, and it is said believed that Facebook uses CNN's for it's facial recognition, user classification and tagging features \citep{adit}. CNN's, in conjunction with recurrent nets, are also used for Facebooks DeepText feature. DeepText is a deep learning text-understanding engine used to comprehend and classify human generated textual content in over 20 languages \citep{DeepText}.
In recent year, neural networks have been used in the field of medicine to better predict diagnoses and detection of cancerous tumours. For example, CNN's have been used by researchers for brain tumor segmentation \citep{DBLP}. The use of CNN's proved to be an appropriate method for tumour segmentation as the results can be given from a range of 25 seconds to 3 minutes \citep{DBLP}. Artificial neural networks have been used by radiologists for Computer-Aided detections systems (CADe) and Computer-aided Diagnosis systems (CADx) to improve the accuracy of diagnoses, early detections and to minimize the time spent on evaluation by doctors \citep{CADe}. 

Many businesses depend on artificial neural networks for their business model as they can be applied to many industries and disciplines. According to \citet{geocities}
artificial neural networks are used in a range of business applications such as forecasting of sales, classification of spending patterns, market targeting, risk analysis and bankruptcy prediction, to name a few.
