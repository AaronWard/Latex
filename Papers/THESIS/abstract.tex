The purpose of this project was to build a machine learning model to classify facial expressions for sentiment analysis. This analysis tool's use case can be applied to retail and marketing fields to replace approached of measuring customer service such as email surveys. The model was built using Python and TensorFlow and is tested using a proof-of-concept web application developed with Node.JS. The model was put under rigorous testing and the findings have been documented, which determined a testing accuracy of 84.47\%. \\ \\
